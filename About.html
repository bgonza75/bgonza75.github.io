      <h2>Hi I'm Blanca Gonzalez Osorio!</h2>
      <p>
    Hi Everyone! My name is Blanca Gonzalez Osorio, and I am 21 years old. I’ve always grown up watching superhero movies — 
    but it hasn’t always been Marvel. The very first superhero show I got into was <span class="ironman">The Flash</span>, and from there I 
    fell in love with the entire Arrowverse. That’s really where my love for all things superheroes began.
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite loving superheroes, I had never watched Marvel at all until COVID hit. I’m the kind of person who has to watch 
    things in order, so I knew I couldn’t dive into Marvel unless I started from the very beginning. COVID gave me 
    the perfect chance to deep dive into the Marvel Cinematic Universe — and I haven’t looked back since! 
  </p>
  <p>
    Ever since then, I’ve kept up with everything Marvel: the movies, the Disney+ shows, and even some of the older 
    Marvel-related films like <span class="ironman">X-Men</span>. It’s been an amazing journey, and this site is my way of sharing that 
    excitement with you. Below are some photos of myself and things I like to do. <a href="InfinitySaga.html">I hope you enjoy reading my reviews of all Marvel films!</a>.</p>
