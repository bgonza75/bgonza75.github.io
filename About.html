          <h2>Hi, I'm Blanca Gonzalez Osorio!</h2>

          <p>
            Hi everyone! My name is <strong>Blanca Gonzalez Osorio</strong>, and I am 21 years old. I’ve always grown up watching superhero movies — but it hasn’t always been Marvel. The very first superhero show I got into was <span class="ironman">The Flash</span>, and from there I fell in love with the entire Arrowverse. That’s really where my love for all things superheroes began.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite loving superheroes, I had never watched Marvel at all until COVID hit. I’m the kind of person who has to watch things in order, so I knew I couldn’t dive into Marvel unless I started from the very beginning. COVID gave me the perfect chance to deep dive into the Marvel Cinematic Universe — and I haven’t looked back since!
          </p>

          <p>
            Ever since then, I’ve kept up with everything Marvel: the movies, the Disney+ shows, and even some of the older Marvel-related films like <span class="ironman">X-Men</span>. It’s been an amazing journey, and this site is my way of sharing that excitement with you. Below are some photos of myself and things I like to do. <a href="infinitysaga.html">I hope you enjoy reading my reviews of all Marvel films!</a>
