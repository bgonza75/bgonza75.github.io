      <h2>MY MARVEL JOURNEY</h2>
<p>
  I’ve always loved superhero movies, but I didn’t start watching Marvel films until 2020. I knew that if I committed, I’d want to experience the franchise from the very beginning. Thanks to Covid-19, I finally had the time to binge them all in release order. The first Marvel movie I watched was <span class="ironman">Iron Man</span>, and to this day he remains one of my favorite heroes. <a href="aboutme.html">Learn more about me and my love for superheroes here</a>.
