        <h2>PHASE 4</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="ironman">Black Widow</span>: <b>7.5/10</b>; I think this film was pretty good. It definitely came too late but I enjoyed it. I wish we would have gotten more background on the Red Room.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Shang-Chi</span>: <b>8/10</b>; This movie was great. I loved all the fight scenes and the legend behind the ten rings.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Eternals </span>: <b>7/10</b>; I actually enjoyed The Eternals. Great characters, fascinating history but there are lots of questions left unanswered. </li>
         <li><span class="ironman">Spider-Man: No Way Home </span>: <b>10/10</b>;I can't even describe how AMAZING this movie is. I never thought I would see all 3 spiderman on screen together but it happened. Also, I am so happy we saw DAREDEVIL!</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</span>: <b>6.5/10</b>; I liked the introduction of America Chavez but wasn't a fan of Wanda's story, I feel like it contradicted the ending of WandaVision where she chose to save the town and not her kids.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Thor: Love and Thunder</span>: <b>4/10</b>; I'm not going to lie, didn't like this one. They tried recreating the humor of Ragnorak and failed. It's the truth.</li>
       <li><span class="ironman"> Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</span>: <b>9.5/10</b>; Beautiful movie and portrayal of grief. I also really liked Namor's character and can't wait to see him in future projects.</li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>PHASE 5</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="ironman">Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</span>: <b>3.5/10</b>; So much potential wasted. I'm sorry it was just bad. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3</span>: <b>10/10</b>; Loved this movie all around. Although it was heart-wrenching learning about Rocket's past it also was beautiful now that he has the Guardians. Best trilogy in the MCU! </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">The Marvels</span>: <b>4/10; </b>I liked seeing characters from the shows - and the post credit scene.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Deadpool & Wolverine</span>: <b>8/10; </b> What a GREAT movie - it was fun, sad, nostalgic. It was everything I expected. Loved seeing all the past heroes get the recognition they deserve! </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Captain America: Brave New World</span>: <b>8/10</b>;Underrated movie. I really liked seeing Sam fully embrace the role of Captain America and am so excited to see more of him as well as the new Falcon. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Thunderbolts</span>: <b>9/10</b>; Beautiful story-telling and portrayal of depression. I think everyone can relate to Bob and feels for him. I loved this group's dynamic and the post credit scene has me super excited for the future of Marvel! </li>
      </ul>

       <h2>PHASE 6</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="ironman">Fantastic Four: First Steps</span>: <b>9.5/10</b>; Exceeded expectations. Loved this movie and how people got it wrong - thinking they weren't going to be able to save their world. There was just one part I wasn't a fan of, how they portrayed Franklin saving his mom was kinda goofy. Despite that one little thing I loved this movie and am excited to see these characters interact with my other favorites. In all transparency I was freaking out when I saw Doctor Doom at the end!!! </li>
