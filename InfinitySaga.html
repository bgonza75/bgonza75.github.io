      <h2>PHASE 1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="ironman">Iron Man</span>: <b>8/10</b>; I love this film! Super-rewatchable and cements Iron Man as the face of the Marvel Universe.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">The Incredible Hulk</span>: <b>5/10</b>; This movie was alright - I've only ever watched it once because it's not even our Bruce Banner.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Iron Man 2</span>: <b>7/10</b>; This movie was good. Loved how Tony learned more about his father, ultimately saving his life: "My greatest creation is you." Also enjoyed Agent Coulson’s moments—I'm a big fan of Agents of Shield!</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Thor</span>: <b>6.5/10</b>; This movie wasn’t bad. Thor grows a lot after being banished for his arrogance. And I don't think Loki is really a villain. He was lied to about where he comes from, lived in Thor’s shadow, and only ever wanted his father’s approval: ‘I could have done it, Father! For you! For all of us!’ </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Captain America The First Avenger </span>: <b>8.5/10</b>; I love this film but it is soooo sad. I love Steve and Bucky's friendship and hate that he didn't jump out at the end, he missed his date. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Avengers </span>: <b>9/10</b>; Spectacular all around. Love all the charcater dynamics but was devastated when Agent Coulson died (or did he?)</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>PHASE 2</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="ironman">Iron Man 3</span>: <b>6.5/10</b>; This film was good. I liked how we got to see more of who Tony is without the suit — his vulnerability, resourcefulness, and humanity really come through. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Thor The Dark World</span>: <b>6/10</b>; This movie was alright. The story with Jane didn’t capture my attention as much, and the villain felt a bit forgettable. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Captain America The Winter Soldier</span>: <b>9/10; </b>One of my absolute favorites. I love how this movie shows Cap trying to navigate a world that’s morally gray. The fight scenes are top-tier, and the emotional weight between Steve and Bucky makes it one of the strongest entries in the MCU.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Guardians of the Galaxy</span>: <b>9/10; </b> Another GREAT movie. I can re-watch this movie a thousand times - that's how good it is. Great storytelling, visuals, and characters. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Avengers Age of Ultron </span>: <b>8/10</b>; I don't understand why more people don't like this movie. I think it has a deep message and is beautifully captures human duality. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Ant Man</span>: <b>8/10</b>; I think Ant Man is so underated, this movie made me laugh, cry, and all of the above. </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>PHASE 3</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="ironman">Civil War</span>: <b>9/10</b>; This film was AMAZING! Team Iron Man all the way; I also loved the introduction of Spider-Man. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Doctor Strange</span>: <b>7.5/10</b>; This movie was good. I loved Dr. Strange's character development from once arrogant to now a powerful sorcerer. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2</span>: <b>8.5/10; </b> I cried so much during this movie. Throughout the film, Quill often mentions being taken as a kid, but I love how Yondu genuinely protected him and how he ultimately found a real family.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Spider-Man Homecoming</span>: <b>9/10; </b> Spider-Man is my favorite superhero of all time. I don't know why people complain about Tom Holand's representation of Spider-Man. In this film, we see Peter truly find his own way. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Thor Ragnorak</span>: <b>9.5/10</b>; The BEST Thor movie to-date. It's funny, has great storytelling, and truly showcases who Thor is.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Black Panther</span>: <b>9.5/10</b>; This movie was a cinematic masterpiece! The visuals, the soundtrack, and the story all came together perfectly. I absolutely loved Killmonger — he’s one of the best villains in the MCU.  </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Avengers Infinity War</span>: <b>10/10</b>; JUST WOW! This film completely changed superhero movies by showing that heroes don’t always win. There are so many incredible moments, and I love how they gave each team their time to shine. Despite crying so much, I think it’s one of the best films in the MCU — intense, emotional, and unforgettable. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Ant Man and the Wasp</span>: <b>6.5/10</b>; This movie was good. I didn't think the villan, Ghost was too memorable but I do like how this film sets up Avengers Endgame. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Captain Marvel</span>: <b>7/10; </b> I don't hate Captain Marvel at all but, do think they just introduced her charcater too late. Although I do like her character dynamic with Nick Fury.</li>
        <li><span class="ironman">Avengers Endgame</span>: <b>10/10; </b> I can't even explain how good this movie is - I hate that I didn't get to experience it in theatres. I never liked the 5 year time jump but it makes sense. No one should be surprised when I say I bawled my eyes out when Iron Man died. </li>
        <li><span class="ironman"> Spider-Man Far From Home</span>: <b>8/10</b>; This movie perfectly portrays Peter's grief and wanting to be a kid but at the end of the day knows he has a repsonsibility. I think Mysterio was a great villain and showcases how people believe anything. </li>
        </ul>
